/* A happy number is a number defined by the following process: Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits,
and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. 
Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers.

Return True if n is a happy number, and False if not. */

1. break the number 19 into separate digits of 1 and 9.
2. square each digit
3. sum the squares
4. check if the sum equals 1
5. if the sum is 1, return true
6.otherwise, go back to step 1 and repeat.

function isHappyNumber(n, counter=0){
  let result = false;
  while(counter<8){
     const numbersArray = n.toString().split('').map(item => item * item)
     const sum = numbersArray.reduce((acc,curr) => acc + curr,0);
     if(sum === 1){
       result = true
     } else {
       counter++;
       isHappyNumber(sum, counter);
     }
  }
 
  return result;
}
console.log(isHappyNumber(19)) // true
